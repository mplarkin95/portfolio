				<p>Hello and welcome to my Website Portfolio page.  Use the sidebar to the left to navigate between <span className='c1'>this page</span>, <span className='c2'>my projects</span>, and <span className='c3'>my resume</span>.</p>
				<p>I am a curious and motivated full-stack web-developer and software engineer.  I have a deep appreciation for agile development, and a dedication to social progress.  Through various positions and projects (which you can check out through the <span className='c1'>sidebar</span>) I have developed skills in React, Rails, Python and Java (just to name a few). I am currently working as a contracted React developer for Carecrew LLC and I am actively looking for an exciting new full time position. </p>
				<p>Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio.  If you are interested in contacting me you can reach me at my email, mplarkin95@gmail.com.
